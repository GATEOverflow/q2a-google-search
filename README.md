# q2a-google-search
Replaces Q2A search with Google Custom Search

This plugin replaces the default Q2A search with Google Custom Search which can include just your site results or a set of sites you want to include.
Google Custom Search code can be obtained from <a href="https://cse.google.com/cse/"> here </a>.

This is useful if you are having blogs running on Q2A which by default is ignred by Q2A search or if you have related sites whose results also you want to include.
